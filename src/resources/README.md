# Simulation and synthesis resources
## Memory initialization files
The folders `meminit_` contain memory and register initialization files that can be used for simulation and synthesis purposes. These folders are generated and populated by the classes [SimulationMemInit](../main/scala/utils/SimulationMemInit.scala) and [SynthesisMemInit](../main/scala/utils/SynthesisMemInit.scala) respectively. 

## KE Matrices
The file `ke.csv` contains the original KE stiffness matrix. Due to the coordinate transform that has been applied due DOF-mappings, different versions of the KE matrix are required, depending on which colouring of the grid is currently being accessed. The files ke-0.csv through ke-7.csv contain these transformed matrices.

Notice that ke-0.csv and ke-7.csv contain the exact same values, likewise for ke-1 and ke-6, ke-2 and ke-5, ke-3 and ke-4.

The directory `ke` contains memory initialization files for the [KEMatrix](../main/scala/execution/KEMatrix.scala). The memory initialization files are generated by [KEMemInit](../main/scala/utils/KEMemInit.scala).

## GTKWave
The directory gtkwave contains translation files for use in GTKWave. More information can be found in the README in that directory.

## Programs
The directory `programs` contains a number of assembly programs that can be run on the ASIP. The program [top](programs/top.txt) contains the full code necessary to perform topology optimization on a 6x6x6 grid.
